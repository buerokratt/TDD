1. Locate Elements Using Classes:
    Use the specific classes mentioned in the DSL to find and interact with elements. For example:
    vertical-tabs__body-placeholder: Represents the placeholder text when no chat is selected.
    vertical-tabs__group-header: Contains the header text for unanswered chats, which may display a dynamic count in parentheses.
    active-chat__group-wrapper Contains just chat.
    active-chat__toolbar: Contains action buttons like "Take Over."
    active-chat__side-actions: Holds various chat management buttons such as "End chat," "Ask Authentication," and "Forward to Colleague."
    active-chat__side-meta: Contains chat metadata like "Id," "End user name," "Device," and "Location."

2. "End chat" Button Visibility:
    The "End chat" button appears only when the user is set to "Present."
    Ensure that the Present/Away switch is in an active state to indicate the user is available.

3. Setup Steps in beforeEach Hook:
    After navigating to the page (page.goto) and waiting for elements to load, call specific helper functions to prepare the page for testing:
    await turnSwitchOn(page);: Activates the Present/Away switch.
    await changeOpenHoursTo24and7();: Configures the chat availability to 24/7.
    await provideData();: Supplies necessary data for the tests.
    await selectFirstItem(page);: Selects the first available item in the list, ensuring content is loaded for the test.

4. Helper Functions:
    These helper functions—turnSwitchOn, changeOpenHoursTo24and7, provideData, and selectFirstItem—are located in the helper.js file within the unanswered directory. They prepare the environment and handle preconditions required for unanswered chats tests.

5. Text that is dynamic should use regExp. For example if some text consist of static text + dynamic number then should get like this:
    await expect(pText).toHaveText(new RegExp(translation.unansweredConversations));

6. Check side actions buttons that they are there and whether they are enabled or disabled

7. End chat dialog opens after clicking on End chat button in active-chat__side-actions

8. Forward to colleague dialog opens after clicking on Forward to colleague button in active-chat__side-actions
