Before checking inputs for some day, consider if WorkingHours are 24/7 switch, closed on weekends switch and the same on all working days switch to be turned off. 
This can be done by adding before actual input tests this part of code:
    const workingHoursSwitch = await page.getByLabel(`${translation.workingHoursAre247}`, { exact: true });
    const isChecked = await workingHoursSwitch.getAttribute('aria-checked');
    if (isChecked === 'true') {
        await workingHoursSwitch.click();
    }

To capture the day sections use this. The day has to be tranlsation of the day meaning for example:

translation.monday

const container = page.locator('.track', { hasText: day });

            // Locate child elements within the specific day's track
            const dayLabel = container.locator('text=' + day);
            const dayToggle = container.locator('button[role="switch"]');
            const startTimeInput = container.locator('.startTime input');
            const endTimeInput = container.locator('.endTime input');


Generate a Playwright test file to validate a Working Time settings page with thorough visibility checks, toggle switch handling, and logical grouping of elements based on the provided business DSL. The file should meet the following criteria:

Requirements:

1. Parsing DSL for Element Locators:
Use nth-instance to apply .nth() for specific repeated elements, where indicated.
Apply text-based locators using translation keys (fetched via getTranslations) as ${translation.key}.
Use getByRole() for headings, getByLabel() for elements associated with labels, getByText() for general text-based locators, and getByPlaceholder() where applicable.

2. Testing Specific UI Interactions:
Toggle Switches: Check the aria-checked state for each toggle switch before clicking to ensure toggles are only clicked if needed. For example, check the switch state for workingHoursAre247 and toggle it only if it’s set to true.
Visibility for All Elements: Confirm visibility for each element (e.g., heading, buttons, switches, inputs). Use contextual locators within specific sections like .track for day-specific elements.
Start and End Time Inputs: For each day of the week, locate startTimeInput and endTimeInput using nth() within the .track container, ensuring they are visible without labels or placeholders.

3. Translation Handling:
Load translations in beforeEach after navigating to the page to prevent security errors.
Use exact matches { exact: true } for similar elements to prevent partial match conflicts.
Translations should be defined as:
  import { getTranslations } from '@translation/languageDetector.js';
  let translation;
  And in beforeEach:
a. Each test should have annotation. So lets add in beforeEach: test.info().annotations.push({ type: 'repository', description: '<description>' });
   where instead of <description> should take value from BusinessDSL description: value. 

b. translation = await getTranslations(page);
   Translation should be after the playwright test has gone to the page to avoid security error. For example:

    await page.goto('https://admin.prod.buerokratt.ee/chat/users');

    test.info().annotations.push({ type: 'repository', description: 'Buerokratt-Chatbot' });

    translation = await getTranslations(page);

4. Page Structure and Grouping:
Main Heading: Check visibility of the main organizationWorkingTime heading.
Header Toggles: Group header switches into a Card Header section, including visibility checks for workingHoursAre247, considerPublicHolidays, closedOnWeekends, and sameOnAllWorkingDays.
Day-Specific Sections: For each day (Monday to Sunday), group checks under Card Body, ensuring visibility of each day’s label, toggle switch, and time inputs (startTimeInput and endTimeInput).
Footer and Notifications: Group footer elements under Card Footer to verify the save button (save), absence notification switches (sendANotificationOfAbsenceToTheClient and sendANotificationOfAbsenceToTheClientWithAContactRequest), and a text input for noCsaAvailableMessage.


Setup Instructions:
Import getTranslations for dynamic translation handling and store translations in a translation variable.
Add a beforeEach hook to navigate to the page (https://admin.prod.buerokratt.ee/chat/working-time), load translations, and include a 3000ms wait to ensure elements load completely.
Use test.info().annotations.push() to annotate each test with the DSL description part value.
Provide a complete Playwright test file that is directly executable without further modifications.

Functionality tests:

Make sure WorkingHours are 24/7 switch is off, closedOnWeekends switch is off, sameWeekends switch is off. Check all the days as mentioned above and go through all the switches and times.
Time format is 00:00:00. There's two more switches that need to be tested: sendANotificationOfAbsenceToTheClient and sendANotificationOfAbsenceToTheClientWithAContactRequest. They are exclusive meaning if one is checked the other one is automatically unchecked. Test the textarea below aswell.
Capture the inital state of the inputs of time and textarea and return them after saving and checking the changes. Break the tests up into logical parts.
